# Creating Slides with Slidev

Slidev is a web-based slides maker and presenter designed for developers. It allows you to create presentations by writing content in Markdown. The main content file is `[slides.md](mdc:slides.md)`.

## Slide Separators

Use `---` padded with a new line to separate your slides.

```markdown
# Slide 1 Title

Content for slide 1.

---

# Slide 2 Title

Content for slide 2.
```

## Frontmatter

Each slide (and the presentation itself) can be configured using YAML frontmatter, placed either at the very beginning of `[slides.md](mdc:slides.md)` for global settings or between slide separators for slide-specific settings.

Common frontmatter options:

*   `title`: Title of the presentation or a specific slide.
*   `info`: Additional information about the presentation (Markdown enabled).
*   `theme`: Specifies the theme (e.g., `seriph`, `default`).
*   `background`: Sets the background image or color for a slide.
    *   Example: `background: https://source.unsplash.com/collection/94734566/1920x1080`
*   `class`: Applies UnoCSS utility classes to the slide.
    *   Example: `class: text-center`
*   `layout`: Defines the layout for the slide (e.g., `two-cols`, `image-right`, `center`).
    *   Example: `layout: two-cols`
*   `layoutClass`: Applies classes to the layout container.
    *   Example: `layoutClass: gap-16` (used with `two-cols`)
*   `transition`: Specifies the slide transition effect (e.g., `slide-left`, `fade-out`, `slide-up`).
    *   Example: `transition: slide-left`
*   `level`: Sets the heading level for the slide title in a Table of Contents.
    *   Example: `level: 2`
*   `drawings`: Configures drawing features.
    *   Example: `drawings: persist: false`
*   `mdc`: Enables MDC (Markdown Components) syntax, a powerful way to use Vue components and apply styles/classes directly in Markdown. See dedicated section below.
    *   Example: `mdc: true`
*   `src`: Imports content from another Markdown file.
    *   Example: `src: ./pages/another-part.md`
*   `hide`: Hides a slide from the presentation.
    *   Example: `hide: true`
*   Other custom frontmatter can be defined by themes or for specific needs (e.g., `image` for image layouts, `dragPos` for draggable elements).

Example of global frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: My Awesome Presentation
theme: seriph
info: |
  More details about this presentation.
---

# First Slide
...
```

Example of slide-specific frontmatter:
```markdown
---
layout: image-right
image: https://example.com/image.jpg
transition: fade-out
---

# Slide with Image Right

This slide has a specific layout and background.
```

## MDC (Markdown Components) Syntax

When `mdc: true` is enabled in your frontmatter (globally or per slide), you can use MDC syntax. This allows for a more concise and powerful way to embed Vue components and apply attributes or classes directly to Markdown elements or components.

It's often considered the easiest way to apply styles and classes.

Example:
```markdown
<!-- Standard Markdown link -->
[Slidev](mdc:https:/sli.dev)

<!-- MDC equivalent, allowing classes or other attributes -->
#title[My Title with MDC]
Regular text.
::div{.p-4 .bg-red-100}
This is a div with padding and a red background, using MDC.
::

<!-- Using a component with MDC -->
::Counter{count=5 initial=2}
::
```
Consult the official [MDC Syntax documentation](mdc:https:/sli.dev/features/mdc) for more details on its capabilities.

## Markdown and HTML

Standard Markdown syntax is fully supported. You can also use HTML directly within your slides for more complex structures or styling.

```html
<div class="mt-4 p-2 bg-gray-100 rounded">
  This is an HTML div with some classes.
</div>
```

## Vue Components

Embed Vue components directly in your Markdown for interactivity. Slidev provides built-in components (e.g., `<Tweet id="..."/>`, `<Youtube id="..."/>`) and you can create your own in the `components/` directory.

```html
<!-- Using a built-in component -->
<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" />

<!-- Using a custom component (e.g., ./components/Counter.vue) -->
<Counter :count="10" />
```

## Code Blocks

Display code snippets with syntax highlighting.

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

### Line Highlighting & TwoSlash

Specify line highlights, diffs, or enable TypeScript hover information with TwoSlash.

```typescript {all|1|2-3} twoslash
// TwoSlash enables TypeScript hover information
import { ref } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0) // This line will be highlighted
```

### Shiki Magic Move

Animate changes between multiple code snippets by wrapping them with ` `````md magic-move ```` ` (four backticks).

````markdown
````md magic-move
```ts
// Step 1
let a = 1;
```

```ts
// Step 2
let a = 1;
let b = 2; // Added this line
```
````
````

### Monaco Editor

Embed a fully functional Monaco editor.

*   `{monaco}`: Turns a code block into an editor.
*   `{monaco-run}`: Creates an editor that can execute the code.

```typescript {monaco-run}
console.log("Hello from Monaco Editor in Slidev!");
```

## Animations

### Click Animations

Use the `v-click` directive to reveal elements sequentially on clicks.
The `v-mark` directive can be used for inline highlighting effects.

```html
<div v-click>Appears on first click.</div>
<div v-click>Appears on second click.</div>

<p>
  This is <span v-mark.underline.blue>important</span> information.
</p>
```

### Motion Animations

Use the `v-motion` directive (from `@vueuse/motion`) for more complex animations.

```html
<div
  v-motion
  :initial="{ opacity: 0, y: 100 }"
  :enter="{ opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { delay: 500 } }"
>
  Animated text
</div>
```
You can define reusable animation presets in a `<script setup>` block on the slide.

## LaTeX

Embed mathematical formulas using KaTeX.

Inline: `$\\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$`

Block:
```latex
$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$
```

## Diagrams

Create diagrams from textual descriptions.

### Mermaid

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision};
    B -- Yes --> C[Outcome 1];
    B -- No --> D[Outcome 2];
```
You can specify scale and theme: ` ```mermaid {scale: 0.8, theme: 'neutral'} ... ``` `

### PlantUML

```plantuml
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
@enduml
```

## Slide Notes

Comments at the end of a slide (the last comment block) are treated as presenter notes. These are visible in Presenter Mode. HTML can be used in notes.

```markdown
Content of the slide.

<!--
This is a presenter note.
**Markdown** and <html> work here too!
[click] Notes can also be synced with `v-click` animations.
-->
```

## Table of Contents (TOC)

Use the `<Toc />` component to generate a table of contents.

```html
<Toc minDepth="1" maxDepth="2" />
```
Slide titles are inferred, or can be set via `title` and `level` in frontmatter.

## Embedding External Files

You can include content from external files to better organize your presentation.

### Importing Entire Slides
Use the `src` frontmatter property to import an entire Markdown file as a single slide or a sequence of slides. This is excellent for reusability and organization.

```markdown
---
# This slide will be content from another-section.md
src: ./sections/another-section.md
---
```

### Embedding Code Snippets
To embed specific code snippets from external files (not entire slides):
```markdown
<!-- Embed a code snippet -->
<<< @/snippets/my-code.ts#snippet-name
```

## Styling

### Inline Styles, Style Tags, and UnoCSS

You can apply inline styles, use `<style>` tags for CSS, and leverage [UnoCSS](mdc:https:/unocss.dev) (if configured in your project) for utility-first styling.

```html
<p style="color: blue;">Blue text with inline style.</p>
<p class="text-green-500">Green text with UnoCSS class.</p>
```

### Slide Scope Styles

By default, `<style>` tags within a slide's Markdown content are **scoped to that specific slide**. This means the styles you define will only affect the current slide, preventing unintended styling on other slides.

```html
<style>
/* These styles only apply to the current slide */
h1 {
  color: steelblue;
  font-size: 2.5em;
}
.my-custom-class-for-this-slide {
  font-weight: bold;
  border: 1px solid green;
}
</style>
```

This is a key feature for maintaining clean and predictable styling across your presentation.

## Draggable Elements
Use `v-drag` directive or `<v-drag>` component for draggable elements.
Use `<v-drag-arrow>` for draggable arrows. Position can be stored in frontmatter (e.g., `dragPos`).

```html
<img v-drag="'logo'" src="/logo.png" />

<v-drag :pos="{x: 100, y: 100}">
  Draggable text
</v-drag>
```
